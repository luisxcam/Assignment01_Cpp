/******************************
Grading Schema: In a separate function you will implement a grading schema. Write a
program that reads a student’s name together with his or her test score from a file given by the user.
The first two values in the file will represent the number of students followed by the number of tests.
The program should then compute the average test score for each student and assign the appropriate
grade (A, B, C, D, E or F) as well as the average of each test. Your program must perform the following
functions.
a) A void function calculateAverage, to determine the average of the test scores for each student.
b) A value-returning function, calculateGrade, to determine and return each student’s grade letter.
c) A void function calculateTestAvg that calculates the average of all tests and overall average of
students.
d) A void function printGrades that prints the grades values, average marks and grade letter
followed by the average of all tests and students.

Write a function that given a list of non-negative integers in the range of 1-99 from the

You must use vectors throughout the program without any uses of arrays.
